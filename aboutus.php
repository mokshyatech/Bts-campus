            <h4>PURPOSE</h4>
            <p>
              The main purpose of our school is to provide for the fullest possible developmentof each learner for living morally, creatively, and productively.
              The one continuing purpose of education, since ancient times,
              has been to bring people to as full a realization as possible of
              what it is to be a human being. Other statements of educational
              purpose have also been widely accepted: to develop the intellect, to serve social needs, to contribute to the economy, to
              create an effective work force, to prepare students for a job or
              career, to promote a particular social or political system.<br> These
              purposes offered are undesirably limited in scope, and in some
              instances they conflict with the broad purpose I have indicated;
              they imply a distorted human existence. The broader humanistic
              purpose includes all of them, and goes beyond them, for it seeks
              to encompass all the dimensions of human experience
